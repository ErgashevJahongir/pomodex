This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Code Quality & Formatting

This project uses ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and consistent formatting.

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Run linter
npm run lint

# Fix linting errors automatically
npm run lint:fix

# Format all files with Prettier
npm run format

# Check formatting without making changes
npm run format:check

# Run both format check and lint
npm run check
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses Husky and lint-staged to automatically lint and format your code before each commit. This ensures that only properly formatted and linted code is committed to the repository.

### Editor Setup

For the best development experience, install the following VS Code extensions:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

The project includes `.vscode/settings.json` with recommended settings for automatic formatting on save.
